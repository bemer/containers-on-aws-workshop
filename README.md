# Welcome to the LTS Container Track

Hello and welcome to the Latam Tech Summit 2017 - Container Track day! This is obviously the most awaited day of the event. We know it... So here are a few things that you should know before you start:

## 1) It's all about containers!

We will walk you through the very basics of containers: from installing and configuring Docker in your machine, running containers locally, till finally deploying them in AWS.

## 2) If you are using a Windows machine (srsly?)

We strongly recommend you to spin up a Linux EC2 instance. None of these labs were even tested in Windows environments.

## 3) This is not everything we have for today. There's more!

You know that thing called Kubernetes? I bet you kow. Be ready, because there's also an amazing lab waiting for you. This lab will start at 3PM and it's going to be nuts!

## 4) Enough of jibber jabber...

Go sharp your Container skills and take over the world.

## 5) Please, run this lab in the exactly order as follows:

* [1. Setup Environments](https://github.com/bemer/lts-workshop/tree/master/01-SetupEnvironment)
