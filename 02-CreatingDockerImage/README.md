## 1. Tutorial overview

This tutorial is going to drive you through the process of creating your first Docker image, running this image locally and pushing it to a image repository. If you are going to execute this lab in the Clou9 environment, you can jump to [2. Creating your first image](/02-CreatingDockerImage#2-creating-your-first-image).

>This Docker image will have a very simple web application that you can find in the `00-Application/app` directory.

In this tutorial, we assume that you completed the [Setup Environment tutorial](/01-EnvironmentSetup) and:

* [Have a working AWS account](<https://aws.amazon.com>)
* [Have a working Github account](<https://www.github.com>)
* [Have the AWS CLI installed](<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html>)

To check if you have the AWS CLI installed and configured:

    $ aws --version

This should return something like:

    $ aws --version
    aws-cli/1.14.9 Python/2.7.13 Linux/4.9.81-35.56.amzn1.x86_64 botocore/1.8.13

> Note that to run this tutorial, you need to have the most recent version of AWS CLI installed.

To check if you have Docker installed:

    $  docker -v

This should return something like:

    Docker version 17.12.0-ce, build 3dfb8343b139d6342acfd9975d7f1068b5b1c3d3

>If you after running the `docker -v` command you don't get this output, please follow the install instructions in [this link](/01-SetupEnvironment#install-docker).

If you have completed these steps, you are good to go!

## 2. Creating your first image

The following steps should be executed on your own computer or Cloud9 instance, if you chose it.

If you haven't executed the `git clone` command present in the [Setup Environment](/01-SetupEnvironment#5-cloning-the-workshop-repository) chapter, do it now using the following command:

    $ git clone https://github.com/bemer/containers-on-aws-workshop.git

Now we are going to build and test our containers locally.  If you've never worked with Docker before, there are a few basic commands that we'll use in this workshop, but you can find a more thorough list in the [Docker "Getting Started" documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/getstarted/).

In this step, we are going to build a *Docker image* with a simple web application. The application that we will be using is available on the directory `00-Application` inside the project folder. In this case, lets's navigate to the `00-Application` directory:

    $ cd containers-on-aws-workshop/00-Application/

Take a look on the contents of this directory. You will see that there is a directory called `app/` and also a file named `Dockerfile`. We will be using this `Dockerfile` to package our web application. In order to do that, run the following command inside the `00-Application` directory:

    $ docker build -t containers-workshop-app .

This should output steps that look something like this:

    Sending build context to Docker daemon  9.295MB
    Step 1/9 : FROM node:alpine
     ---> 5ce79d7a9aad
    Step 2/9 : COPY app/ /app
     ---> 5db182714408
    Step 3/9 : WORKDIR /app
    Removing intermediate container 0fed50590e13
     ---> 8b89b65c5c67
    Step 4/9 : RUN npm install --global gulp && npm install gulp
     ---> Running in f86ae7a1e8bb

If the container builds successfully, the output should end with something like this:

    Successfully built 0c50204fc662
    Successfully tagged containers-workshop-app:latest

To run your container:

     $  docker run -d -p 8080:80 containers-workshop-app

To check if your container is running:

     $ docker ps

This should return a list of all the currently running containers.  In this example,  it should just return a single container, the one that we just started:

    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                     COMMAND             CREATED                  STATUS              PORTS                          NAMES
    1255ca3087f5        containers-workshop-app   "node server.js"    Less than a second ago   Up 1 second         0.0.0.0:80->8080/tcp, 8080/tcp   nifty_snyder



To test the application, you can use the Cloud9 `Preview Running Application` feature. In Cloud9, click in `Preview` > `Preview Running Application`

![Preview Running Application](/02-CreatingDockerImage/images/preview_application.png)

If everything went fine, you should see your web application:

![Web Application](/02-CreatingDockerImage/images/web_application.png)



## 3. Setting up the IAM roles

**This step is only needed if you are doing the workshop using your own computer. If you are using the Cloud9 environment, you can go ahead to the step [5. Creating the image repository with ECR](/02-CreatingDockerImage#5-creating-the-image-repository-with-ecr)**

In order to work with the AWS CLI, you'll need an IAM role with the proper permissions set up.  To do this, we'll create both an IAM Group, and an IAM user.

To create the group, navigate to the [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1#/home), and select **Groups** > **Create New Group**.  Name the group "**containers-workshop-group**".  From the list of managed policies, add the following policies:

* AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess
* AmazonEC2ContainerServiceFullAccess

This is how your group permissions should like after the creation:

![IAM group permissions](/02-CreatingDockerImage/images/iam_group_permissions.png)

Once you've created your group, you need to create a new user and attach this new user to this group. In order to do so, on the IAM console, click in **Users** on the left side of the screen, and them click in the button **Add user**.

The user name will be **containers-workshop-user**. Don't forget to select the **Programmatic access** and the **AWS Management Console access** in the `Access type` just like in the following picture:

![creating user](/02-CreatingDockerImage/images/creating_user.png)

Now, click in **Next: permissions** and in the **Add user to group** screen, select the group `containers-workshop-group` that we created before:

![add user to group](/02-CreatingDockerImage/images/add_user_to_group.png)

>NOTE: If you already have more groups created in your account, you can use the `Search` on the IAM console to find the group that you created before, just like in the picture.

Click in **Next: Review** and check if is everything fine with your user creation. The screen should be similar to this one:

![review user creation](/02-CreatingDockerImage/images/review_user_creation.png)

In this screen, click in **Create user**.

When the wizard finishes, make sure to download and save your access key and secret key.  You'll need them in the next step.

>NOTE: The Secret access key is presented only once, during the user creation. If you loose this information, you will need to create a new Access and Secret keys in order to authenticate with this user.

## 4. Configuring the AWS CLI

**This step is only needed if you are doing the workshop using your own computer. If you are using the Cloud9 environment, you can go ahead to the step [5. Creating the image repository with ECR](/02-CreatingDockerImage#5-creating-the-image-repository-with-ecr)**


If you've never configured the AWS CLI, the easiest way is by running the command:

    $ aws configure

This should drop you into a setup wizard. In this wizard, complete each field with the informations generated in the user creation step:

    $ aws configure
    AWS Access Key ID [****************K2JA]:
    AWS Secret Access Key [****************Oqx+]:
    Default region name [us-east-1]:
    Default output format [json]:

If you already have a profile setup with the AWS CLI, you can also add a new profile to your credentials file. In order to add another profile, edit your credentials (usually located in *~/.aws/credentials*) and add a new profile called "**containers-workshop**". After adding this new profile, your credentials file will be like this:

    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = AKIABCDMYKEYEXAMPLE1
    aws_secret_access_key = CAFESECRETACCESSKEYEXAMPLE001

    [containers-workshop]
    aws_access_key_id = AKIABCDMYKEYEXAMPLE2
    aws_secret_access_key = CAFESECRETACCESSKEYEXAMPLE002


You can test that your IAM user has the correct permissions, and that your CLI is setup to connect to your AWS account by running the command to obtain an ECR authentication token.  This will allow us to pull the Docker image to our repository in the next step:

    $ aws ecr get-login --no-include-email

This should output something like:

    docker login -u AWS -p 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 https://XXXXXXXXX.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com


> The '-e' option has been deprecated in the `docker login` command and was removed in docker version 17.06 and later. You must specify --no-include-email if you're using docker version 17.06 or later. The default behavior is to include the '-e' flag in the 'docker login' output.

>NOTE: If you already had the credentials file and just added a new profile in it, don't forget to use the `--profile container-workshop` in the end of the command. This is needed because every time that you run a command using the awscli, it is going to use the `default` profile, so if we want to use a different one, we need to specify when running the command.


## 5. Creating the image repository with ECR

Before we can build and push our images, we need somewhere to push them to.  In this case, we're going to create just one repository in [ECR](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/).

To create a repository, navigate to the [ECR console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr). If this is the first time that you are accessing the ECR console, you will see the **Get Started** button in the top right corner. Click in it:

![get started ecr](/02-CreatingDockerImage/images/getting_started_ecr.png)


Name your first repository **containers-workshop-app**:

![create ecr repository](/02-CreatingDockerImage/images/creating_repository.png)

Once you've created the repository, you will be redirected to the ECR main screen. You will be able to see your newly created repository:

![ecr main screen](/02-CreatingDockerImage/images/ecr_main_screen.png)

Now, access your repository by clicking in its name. Now, click in the button **View push commands** in the top right corner. It will display a list of commands that you will need to use to push your Docker images. These commands will be like this:

![push commands](/02-CreatingDockerImage/images/push_commands.png)

## 6. Pushing our tested images to ECR

Now that we've tested our images locally, we need to tag them again, and push them to ECR.  This will allow us to use them in `Task definitions` that can be deployed to an ECS cluster.  

You'll need your push commands that you saw during registry creation.  If you've misplaced your push commands, you can find them again by going back to the repository (**ECR Console** > **Repositories** > Select the repository you want to see the commands for > **View Push Commands**.

The first thing that we need to do, is authenticate our Docker client to the ECR. To do this, we need get the `docker login` command with the repository informations. To get this informations, run the following command:

    $ aws ecr get-login --no-include-email

The output of this command is the `docker login` command that we wil need to run. It is going to be similar to:

    docker login -u AWS -p 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 https://XXXXXXXXX.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com

To login to ECR, copy this output and execute it as a linux command. The output will be the following:

    WARNING! Using --password via the CLI is insecure. Use --password-stdin.
    Login Succeeded


>NOTE: If you are running it in a linux terminal, you can just run the command like this `aws ecr get-login --no-include-email` which will tell your shell to execute the output of the first command.  

If you are unable to login to ECR, check your IAM user group permissions.

Now, let's tag our image locally and them push our image to the ECR repository. Use the following commands:

    $ docker tag containers-workshop-app:latest XXXXXXXXX.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/containers-workshop-app:latest
    $ docker push XXXXXXXXX.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/containers-workshop-app:latest

>NOTE: Remember to replace the `XXXXXXXXX` with your account ID. This information will be presented to you in the ECR screen with the Docker push commands.

> Why `:latest`?  This is the actual image tag.  In most production environments, you'd tag images for different schemes:  for example, you might tag the most up-to-date image with `:latest`, and all other versions of the same container with a commit SHA from a CI job.  If you push an image without a specific tag, it will default to `:latest`, and untag the previous image with that tag.  For more information on Docker tags, see the Docker [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/getstarted/step_six/).


This step will take some minutes. When the command finishes, you should see something like this:

    The push refers to a repository [XXXXXXXXX.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/containers-workshop-app]
    9ef5219507db: Pushed
    b3d18e8f520f: Pushed
    a83b4d2ff3a0: Pushed
    2f5b0990636a: Pushed
    c9748fbf541d: Pushed

You can see your pushed images by viewing the repository in the AWS Console.  Alternatively, you can use the CLI:

    $ aws ecr list-images --repository-name=containers-workshop-app
    {
        "imageIds": [
            {
                "imageTag": "latest",
                "imageDigest": "sha256:38588bb240b57d123522ab3d23107cec6438d7a99f1379445fbea27dafc58608"
            }
        ]
    }
